  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>
    MW Consulting Engineers was founded in 2025 with a clear purpose: to redefine how structural engineering services are delivered. We recognised a gap between what clients expect and what the industry often provides—delays, poor communication, and designs that don't translate well to construction. At MW, we’re here to change that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our vision is to lead the way in innovative structural design by embracing new materials and cutting-edge engineering technology. We aim to provide high-quality, practical, and buildable solutions that meet real-world construction needs—on time, and on budget.
  </p>

  <p>
    MW works with clients of all sizes, from individual homeowners to large developers and contractors. We specialise in a broad range of sectors including residential, industrial, commercial, mining, education, and healthcare. Whether it's a house extension or a major industrial facility, our approach remains the same: professional, responsive, and solution-focused.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our team is made up entirely of senior-level engineers and Chartered Professional Engineers (CPEng) registered in Australia. Collectively, our people bring decades of hands-on experience from some of the country’s most respected engineering firms, including AECOM, Meinhardt, FMG Engineering, Structerre, and Spanlift Australia.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a base in Brisbane, we currently serve clients across Queensland, offering quick turnaround times, clear communication, and engineering that works in practice—not just on paper.
  </p>

  <p>
    At MW Consulting Engineers, we don’t just design structures. We deliver confidence, buildability, and results.
